Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room was a simulated client that wanted to create an online browser-based game.  This would require a complex solution to web hosting technology including user-authentication and game hosting.
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I studied multiple operating platforms and attempted to guide the client towards the best one based on their specifications.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  While working with a design document, it helped me solidify the coding ideas in my mind and how they work together.  It is a good practice for any Computer Science student or professional.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would have included a detailed game design section into the document if I was expected to.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The users needs can always be translated into the final project, usually in many different ways.  In our case, using Maven through Java, it is important to understand your particular solutions.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  Develop products sequentially.  Make use of encapsulation- making sure that all the moving parts are completely compatible.  Test each module individually and frequently.
